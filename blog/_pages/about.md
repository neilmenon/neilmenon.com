Neat, you found my blog!

I started this blog primarily as a personal reference for technical issues that I have managed to solve in the past. I find that these seemingly one-off problems end up appearing again at one point or another, and I always seem to forget how I fixed the issue the first time I encountered it. 

Having to re-scroll through pages of Google search results is less than ideal.

I also figure that if I couldn't easily find a solution to my issue then there's probably someone else out there in the same boat. I hope that my posts will be useful to another seeking a solution to the same problem. 

If you have any questions, comments, or changes, feel free shoot me an [email](mailto:nkm5gz@virginia.edu)!
